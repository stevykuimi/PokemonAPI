# CRUD Project README

## Overview

This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that allows users to perform CRUD operations on [describe what kind of data your application manages, e.g., "products", "customers", etc.]. It provides a RESTful API for interacting with the data.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core Web API:** Provides the backend infrastructure for the CRUD operations.
- **Entity Framework Core:** ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for interacting with the database.
- **Swagger:** API documentation tool for exploring and testing the endpoints.
- **Dependency Injection:** Used for managing dependencies and promoting loose coupling.
- **xUnit:** Unit testing framework for writing and executing unit tests.
- **Moq:** Mocking library for creating mock objects in unit tests.
- **[Any other technologies or libraries you've used]**
